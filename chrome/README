Save My Tabs
============

DESCRIPTION
===========

Save My Tabs is an extension for Google Chrome that periodically saves info
on all of your open tabs to a text file (window and tab numbers, URL and title
of each tab).

USAGE
=====

Save My Tabs doesn't require any user intervention. Every several minutes, as
defined by it's preferences, extension creates a new local database file in the
User Data directory, as defined in:

http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory

, that contains info on all open tabs user had kept opened by the time the file
was created. Each database contains 2 tables:

- 'save_my_tabs_options': contains a single record with the name of database
  in the 'name' field;

- 'save_my_tabs_records': contains records on open tabs. Each record contains
  window index ('winindex' field), tab index within the window ('tabindex'),
  URL of tab ('url') and tab title ('title').

Default backup period is 15 minutes. User can change this value through the
Options page: navigate your Chrome to 'chrome://extensions' URL, and click
"Options" link of "Save My Tabs" extension. "Update" button saves the new
value of backup period.

PACKAGING
=========

The .crx file can be created with the help of Chrome browser. Navigate the
Chrome to 'chrome://extensions' URL, expand the 'Developer mode' selector
(right side of 'Extensions' band), click on 'Pack extension' button and choose
the directory where source files are.

INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed either by drag-and-dropping the 'savemytabs.crx'
file over an existing Chrome window, or, if you have the extension source files

  and user data directory path, as defined in:

  [user-data-dir]/databases/chrome-extension_[ID]_0/

2. SQL statements.
