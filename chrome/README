Save My Tabs
============

DESCRIPTION
===========

Save My Tabs is an extension for Google Chrome that periodically saves info
on all of your open tabs to a text file (window and tab numbers, URL and title
of each tab).

USAGE
=====

Save My Tabs doesn't require any user intervention. Every several minutes, as
defined by it's preferences, extension creates a new local database file in the
User Data directory, as defined in:

http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory

, that contains info on all open tabs user had kept opened by the time the file
was created. Each database contains 2 tables:

- 'save_my_tabs_options': contains a single record with the name of database
  in the 'name' field;

- 'save_my_tabs_records': contains records on open tabs. Each record contains
  window index ('winindex' field), tab index within the window ('tabindex'),
  URL of tab ('url') and tab title ('title').

Default backup period is 15 minutes. User can change this value through the
Options page: navigate your Chrome to 'chrome://extensions' URL, and click
"Options" link of "Save My Tabs" extension. "Update" button saves the new
value of backup period.

PACKAGING
=========

The .crx file can be created with the help of Chrome browser. Navigate the
Chrome to 'chrome://extensions' URL, expand the 'Developer mode' selector
(right side of 'Extensions' band), click on 'Pack extension' button and choose
the directory where source files are.

INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed either by drag-and-dropping the 'savemytabs.crx'
file over an existing Chrome window, or, if you have the extension source files
unpacked, by navigating Chrome to 'chrome://extensions' URL, expanding the
'Developer mode' selector (right side of 'Extensions' band), clicking 'Load
unpacked extension' and choosing the folder where the source files are.

EXTRACTING DATA
===============

1. Prerequisites.

Before extracting the data from database files, you should have the following
at hand:

- SQLite executable for your operating system. Precompiled binaries for some
  operating systems can be downloaded from:

  http://www.sqlite.org/download.html

- Extension ID. This can be retrieved from the Chrome's extensions control page
 ('chrome://extensions'); ID is 32-symbol string just below the description of
  'Save My Tabs'.

- path to the user's database directory, derived from the extension ID (above)
  and user data directory path, as defined in:

  http://www.chromium.org/user-experience/user-data-directory

Database path is:

  [user-data-dir]/databases/chrome-extension_[ID]_0/

2. Extraction procedures.

Bundled with the extension are the batch file (Windows) and bash script (Linux)
that will help with the data extraction.

Before running the scripts, one should:

- go to the Chrome's user directory (see above), enter "\default\databases\"
  directory and write down the name of directory that starts with
 "chrome-extension_";

- edit the directory path in the batch file/bash script, so script has a
  correct path to it;

- be sure to have the SQLite executable in the same directory where the batch
  file is.

2.1. Windows:

Run the "extract.bat" to extract the data from Chrome user databases to the
tab-separated files. Script creates one or more (equal to the number of new
databases created by extension) .txt files in the same directory where the
batch file is.

Note that "extract.bat" file can be run from any directory, given the SQLite
executable is in the same directory and paths in the batch file are correct.

2.2. Linux:

Todo.
