Save My Tabs
============

DESCRIPTION
===========

Save My Tabs is an extension for Mozilla Firefox that periodically saves info
on all of your open tabs to a text file (URL and title of each tab).

USAGE
=====

Save My Tabs doesn't require any user intervention. Every several minutes, as
defined by it's preferences, extension creates a new file (in the directory
that's path is stored in preferences), that contains info on all open tabs
user had kept opened by the time the file was created. One line per tab; each
line contains URL of the tab and it's title, separated by a tabular delimiter.

Default period is 15 minutes between backups; default directory is user's
profile (Windows) or home (Linux/Mac OS X) directory.

User can change these values through the Options dialog (Tools menu, Addons
item, "Options" button of "Save My Tabs"). "Choose directory" button allows
user to choose the directory where the files will be created; "Reset to
default" button returns the directory to it's "Home" value.

PACKAGING
=========

The .xpi file can be created manually by using the 'zip' command (or any other
zipping software). The resulting .xpi file should contain the following files:

chrome/content/options.js
chrome/content/options.xul
chrome/content/overlay.js
chrome/content/overlay.xul
chrome/locale/en-US/savemytabs.dtd
chrome/skin/options.css
chrome/skin/savemytabs.png
defaults/preferences/savemytabs.js
install.rdf
chrome.manifest

Under linux, the following instruction builds the .xpi file:

$ zip -r savemytabs.xpi install.rdf chrome.manifest chrome defaults

INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed by drag-and-dropping the 'savemytabs.xpi' file
over an existing Firefox window, or by pointing Firefox (through File menu,
"Open File..." item) to the local URL where the file is stored.
